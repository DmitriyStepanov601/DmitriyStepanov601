# Frontend React JS Developer

My name is Dmitry, I am 24 years old. I have been studying programming since 2013. 

## Current Tech Stack

<b>Additional skills:</b> C# (WinForms), Java (Swing Library)


## First projects

After 4 years, I started learning the Java programming language, which is more focused on server-side development. But before that, as I felt for myself, during the well-known pandemic, I practiced using the old Swing graphics library, which is currently practically not used anywhere except for some companies.

The picture shows a desktop application written in C# using WinForms, which includes several developed games, as part of learning another language - Java 8.

## Graduation project

Within the framework of the diploma project, it was proposed to improve the work of the advisory and educational center "Path to Health", which consisted in the development of an online store on any content management system (CMS). Among the huge list of CMS systems, CMS WordPress was chosen, which has a large number of various plugins for various purposes.

The presented pictures show the appearance of the online store, namely the main page, which presents the services provided by the center and the page telling about the organization itself. Eventually, the developed online store was transferred to the organization for implementation.
