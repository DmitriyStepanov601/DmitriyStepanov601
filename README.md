## About me

My name is Dmitry, I am 24 years old. I have been studying programming since 2013. At that time, I considered programming languages such as C, C++, C#, where I performed small tasks. 

## First projects

After 4 years, I started learning the Java programming language, which is more focused on server-side development. But before that, as I felt for myself, during the well-known pandemic, I practiced using the old Swing graphics library, which is currently practically not used anywhere except for some companies.
